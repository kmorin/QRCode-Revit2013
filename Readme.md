QRcode-Revit2013
----------------

Generate QRcodes within Revit 2013 using native Detail objects (filled regions) and group each instance together.

*Known issue: FilledRegion generation is very slow. Still trying to optimize, but I think it is just the nature of Revit in creating this sort of object. Messed with creating in-place generic models, but that was even worse and not practical.
